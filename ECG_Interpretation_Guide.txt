1. Physiology behind ECG waves (brief)
- The surface ECG records summed electrical vectors of myocardial depolarization and repolarization.
  - P wave: atrial depolarization (primarily right and left atria sequentially). Normal: small, smooth, <120 ms duration.
  - PR interval: time from atrial depolarization onset to ventricular depolarization onset (AV nodal delay + atrial conduction + His conduction).
  - QRS complex: ventricular depolarization (rapid conduction through His–Purkinje system). Narrow QRS reflects normal conduction; wide QRS reflects intraventricular conduction delay or ventricular origin.
  - ST segment: isoelectric period between ventricular depolarization and repolarization; sensitive to injury currents.
  - T wave: ventricular repolarization (vector influenced by transmural and regional recovery gradients).
  - U wave: small wave after the T in some leads; associated with late repolarization of Purkinje fibers or midmyocardial cells (seen in hypokalemia, bradycardia).
- Lead system: 12 leads provide different projection vectors: frontal plane (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) and horizontal plane (V1–V6).

2. Systematic ECG interpretation — a practical stepwise approach
1) Patient, date/time, calibration, paper speed (usually 25 mm/s), amplitude (10 mm = 1 mV).
2) Rate (ventricular and atrial when possible).
3) Rhythm: regularity, P–QRS relationship, presence/absence of P waves, AV association.
4) P-wave morphology (size, axis, bifidity/biphasic).
5) PR interval: measure and assess constant vs. variable.
6) QRS duration and morphology (narrow vs. wide, axis).
7) QRS axis in frontal plane.
8) Hypertrophy/chamber enlargement criteria.
9) ST‑segment deviations (elevation/depression) and morphology (convex, concave, horizontal).
10) T‑wave abnormalities (peaked, flattened, inverted, symmetric vs. asymmetric).
11) QT and QTc measurement.
12) Look for U waves, pathological Q waves, and electrical alternans.
13) Compare with previous ECGs and correlate clinically.

3. Measurements and normal values
- Paper speed: 25 mm/s (1 small box = 0.04 s, 1 large box = 0.20 s).
- Voltage: 10 mm = 1 mV (1 small box = 0.1 mV).
- Heart rate: 300 / number of large boxes between consecutive R waves (regular rhythm) or count QRS in 6‑second strip × 10 (irregular rhythm).
- Normal intervals:
  - PR interval: 120–200 ms (0.12–0.20 s).
  - QRS duration: <120 ms (<0.12 s) — narrow; 120–140 ms borderline; ≥120 ms wide.
  - QT interval: rate dependent; measure in a lead with clear end of T; QTc by Bazett = QT / √RR (seconds). Common reference QTc: <440 ms (men), <460 ms (women). QTc >500 ms confers higher torsades risk.
- Axis: normal −30° to +90° (some sources use −30° to +100°). Left axis deviation: −30° to −90°. Right axis deviation: +90° to +180°.

4. Detailed waveform analysis

P wave
- Normal: ≤120 ms duration, amplitude ≤2.5 mm in limb leads, smooth dome in II.
- Right atrial enlargement (RAE): tall, peaked P waves in II >2.5 mm; V1 P wave tall initial component may be increased.
- Left atrial enlargement (LAE): P wave duration >120 ms, bifid (notched) P in lead II (P‑mitrale), or biphasic P in V1 with terminal negative portion ≥40 ms duration and ≥1 mm depth.

PR interval
- Prolongation >200 ms = first-degree AV block.
- Short PR <120 ms suggests pre‑excitation (e.g., WPW) or junctional rhythm.
- Variable PR with nonconducted P waves suggests second‑degree AV block.

QRS complex
- Duration:
  - Normal <120 ms.
  - Intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) 110–119 ms (sometimes called incomplete bundle branch block).
  - Bundle branch block (complete) ≥120 ms.
- Morphology:
  - Left bundle branch block (LBBB): QRS ≥120 ms; broad monomorphic R in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6); absent initial Q in lateral leads; secondary ST‑T changes (discordant).
  - Right bundle branch block (RBBB): QRS ≥120 ms; rsR' (M‑pattern) in V1–V3; wide S waves in I and V6.
  - Dominant Q wave: pathological Q wave suggests transmural infarction if ≥40 ms and depth ≥25% of ensuing R wave in contiguous leads (context and clinical correlation required).

QT and QTc
- Measure QT from beginning of QRS to end of T; choose a lead with clear end of T (commonly V5 or II).
- Correct for heart rate: QTc by Bazett frequently used (QTc = QT/√RR). Note Bazett overcorrects at extremes of rate; consider Fridericia or linear formulas in nuanced contexts.
- QTc thresholds:
  - Normal: <440 ms (men), <460 ms (women).
  - Considered prolonged when ≥450 ms men, ≥470 ms women; markedly prolonged if ≥500 ms.
- Prolongation predisposes to torsades de pointes.

ST segment
- ST elevation: evaluate at J point relative to baseline (PR segment); morphology matters:
  - Convex/upward (domed) elevation more suggestive of acute injury (STEMI).
  - Concave elevation may be benign (early repolarization) or pericarditis.
- Significant ST elevation (general rule):
  - ≥1 mm (0.1 mV) in two contiguous limb leads or leads V4–V6.
  - In V2–V3 higher thresholds: men ≥2 mm (0.2 mV), women ≥1.5 mm (0.15 mV) (age dependent). (Clinical guidelines vary; always integrate clinical context.)
- ST depression: horizontal or downsloping ≥0.5–1.0 mm in contiguous leads implies ischemia; ST depression in anterior leads may represent posterior MI (reciprocal).

T wave
- Normal T: upright in leads with upright QRS, asymmetrical (slow upstroke, rapid downstroke).
- Peaked, narrow, tall T waves: hyperkalemia (early ECG sign).
- Wide, symmetric, very tall T waves with QT prolongation and altered morphology can indicate CNS catastrophe (classically).
- T inversion: ischemia, recent infarct, left ventricular strain; symmetric deep inversions are more concerning for ischemia.
- Persistent T inversion in certain leads can indicate prior infarction or cardiomyopathy.

U wave
- Small positive deflection after T, best seen in V2–V3.
- Prominent U waves: hypokalemia, bradycardia, drug effects (digitalis can change U wave), congenital long QT syndromes.

5. Rhythm disturbances — identification and diagnostic criteria

Sinus rhythms
- Normal sinus rhythm (NSR): P wave before each QRS, consistent morphology, PR 120–200 ms, regular RR.
- Sinus bradycardia: sinus rate <60/min; often normal in athletes, or due to drugs/AV nodal disease.
- Sinus tachycardia: rate >100/min; physiologic or pathologic.

Supraventricular arrhythmias
- Atrial fibrillation (AF):
  - Absent discrete P waves, chaotic baseline fibrillatory waves, irregularly irregular RR intervals.
  - Rate: variable; rapid ventricular response common.
- Atrial flutter (AFL):
  - Rapid, regular atrial activity (typical atrial flutter 240–340/min) with “sawtooth” flutter waves best in II, III, aVF.
  - Ventricular response often 2:1, 3:1, or variable conduction.
- Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT):
  - Irregular rhythm with three or more morphologically distinct P waves and varying PR intervals; rate >100/min.
  - Often seen with COPD/exacerbation or hypoxia.
- Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) / AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT):
  - Regular narrow complex tachycardia, rate typically 150–250/min, P waves often absent/fused with QRS or retrograde P after QRS.

Ventricular arrhythmias
- Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs):
  - Wide QRS (>120 ms), no preceding P wave, compensatory pause often present, morphology depends on origin.
- Ventricular tachycardia (VT):
  - Wide complex tachycardia (>120 ms), usually regular, rate >100–120/min. Monomorphic VT has uniform QRS morphology; polymorphic VT varies.
  - Look for AV dissociation, capture or fusion beats to support VT over SVT with aberrancy.
- Ventricular fibrillation (VF):
  - Chaotic, disorganized electrical activity with no discernible QRS complexes, immediate life-threatening.

6. Atrioventricular (AV) blocks and their ECG features
- First-degree AV block:
  - PR interval >200 ms, every P conducted (one‑to‑one).
- Second-degree AV block — Mobitz I (Wenckebach):
  - Progressive PR prolongation until a nonconducted P wave; often narrow QRS and at AV nodal level.
- Second-degree AV block — Mobitz II:
  - Intermittent nonconducted P waves without progressive PR prolongation; usually fixed PR intervals before dropped beats; often infranodal and more likely to progress to complete block.
- 2:1 AV block:
  - Every second P wave is nonconducted; cannot distinguish Mobitz I vs. II on ECG alone — clinical context, QRS width and site of block help.
- Third-degree (complete) AV block:
  - AV dissociation with independent atrial (P) and ventricular (QRS) rates; escape rhythm origin determines QRS width and rate (junctional 40–60 bpm narrow, ventricular 20–40 bpm wide).

7. Bundle branch blocks and fascicular blocks

Right bundle branch block (RBBB)
- Complete RBBB:
  - QRS ≥120 ms.
  - rsR′ or rSR′ (“M” pattern) in V1–V3.
  - Wide S waves in I and V6.
  - Secondary ST–T changes (discordant).
- Incomplete RBBB:
  - QRS 100–119 ms with similar morphology.

Left bundle branch block (LBBB)
- QRS ≥120 ms.
- Broad, notched or slurred R wave in I, aVL, V5–V6.
- Absence of Q waves in lateral leads (I, V5–V6).
- ST–T changes opposite (discordant) to major QRS deflection.
- LBBB usually obscures ECG diagnosis of acute MI; use clinical correlation and Sgarbossa/modified Sgarbossa criteria.

Fascicular (hemiblocks)
- Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB / left anterior hemiblock):
  - Left axis deviation (commonly −45° to −90°).
  - Small Q in lead I and small R in lead III (qR in I, rS in III).
  - QRS duration usually normal (unless concomitant conduction disease).
- Left posterior fascicular block (LPFB / left posterior hemiblock):
  - Right axis deviation (commonly +90° to +180°).
  - Small R in lead I and small Q in lead III (rS in I, qR in III).
  - Must exclude other causes of RAD (RVH, lateral MI, limb lead misplacement).

8. Chamber enlargement and hypertrophy criteria

Left atrial enlargement (LAE)
- P wave in lead II: duration >120 ms, often notched (two peaks).
- V1 biphasic P with terminal negative portion ≥40 ms duration and ≥1 mm deep.

Right atrial enlargement (RAE)
- P wave amplitude in lead II >2.5 mm (tall, peaked P wave).
- In V1, P wave initial component tall (>1.5 mm).

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
- Voltage criteria (examples; sensitivity limited):
  - Sokolow–Lyon: S in V1 + R in V5 or V6 ≥35 mm (≥35 mV).
  - Cornell: R in aVL + S in V3 >28 mm (men) or >20 mm (women).
- LV strain pattern: ST depression and asymmetric T‑wave inversion in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6) usually with voltage criteria.
- Use clinical context and imaging confirmation (echo).

Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
- Right axis deviation >+90° (if not due to other causes).
- R wave in V1 >7 mm or R/S ratio >1 in V1; S wave in V5–V6 >7 mm.
- In severe RVH, R waves persist across right precordial leads.

Notes: Voltage criteria alone have limited sensitivity; integrate with clinical history and imaging (echocardiography).

9. Acute myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI)

General principles
- Ischemia vs. injury vs. infarction:
  - Ischemia: T‑wave inversion or ST depression (subendocardial).
  - Injury: ST elevation (acute transmural).
  - Infarction: Q waves developing (necrosis) with persistent ST–T changes.

STEMI diagnostic thresholds (clinical context dependent)
- Classic rule: New ST elevation at the J point in two contiguous leads:
  - ≥1 mm (0.1 mV) in all leads other than V2–V3.
  - V2–V3: ≥2 mm in men (≥20 years), ≥1.5 mm in women (≥20 years); thresholds may vary by age and guideline updates.
- Always interpret with clinical presentation and prior ECGs; small elevations in early repolarization or pericarditis can mimic STEMI.

Localization by leads (contiguous-lead groupings)
- Inferior wall: II, III, aVF — typically RCA or sometimes LCx; look for reciprocal ST depression in I or aVL.
  - Infero‑RV infarct: inferior STE with more STE in III > II and ST depression in V2 and V3; obtain right‑sided leads (V4R).
- Lateral wall: I, aVL, V5–V6 — usually left circumflex or diagonal branches.
  - High lateral: I, aVL.
  - True lateral (V5–V6).
- Anterior wall: V1–V4 (V1–V3 sometimes septal/anterior) — LAD territory.
- Septal: V1–V2.
- Posterior wall: reciprocal ST depression in V1–V3 with tall R waves and upright T waves; confirm with posterior leads V7–V9 showing ST elevation.
- Right ventricular infarction: diagnose with right‑sided chest leads (V3R–V4R); common with inferior MI when RCA proximal.

Reciprocal changes
- ST depression in leads electrically opposite the leads with ST elevation (e.g., ST elevation in II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST depression in I, aVL).
- Reciprocal changes support acute ischemia and increase specificity for STEMI.

Evolutional stages of transmural infarction on ECG
- Hyperacute stage:
  - Early, minutes: very tall, peaked, broad-based T waves (hyperacute T waves) often earliest sign in affected leads.
- Acute (injury) stage:
  - J‑point and ST elevation develops; PR depression may be seen with pericarditis but can also accompany transmural injury at times; reciprocal ST depression in opposite leads.
- Early subacute (hours to days):
  - ST elevation persists or begins to resolve; T‑wave inversion begins as ST normalizes.
- Evolving (days‑weeks):
  - Q waves develop (pathologic Q if >40 ms or depth >25% of R in same lead) indicating myocardial necrosis; T waves deeply inverted.
- Chronic (weeks‑months):
  - Q waves persist; ST segments normalize; T waves may remain inverted or normalize.

Special considerations
- Posterior MI: look for horizontal ST depression and tall R waves in V1–V3; obtain posterior leads (V7–V9).
- Right ventricular infarct: consider in inferior STEMI; look at V4R.
- LBBB or paced rhythm: diagnosis of STEMI is more difficult. Apply Sgarbossa/modified Sgarbossa (Smith) criteria:
  - Concordant ST elevation ≥1 mm in any lead (score 5).
  - Concordant ST depression ≥1 mm in V1–V3 (score 3).
  - Excessively discordant ST elevation (ST elevation ≥25% of preceding S wave amplitude) — modified criterion uses ST/S ratio ≥0.25 (score 2). A total Sgarbossa score ≥3 suggests MI.
- Early repolarization and pericarditis can mimic STEMI — use morphology (diffuse concave ST elevation and PR depression suggests pericarditis), serial ECGs, and troponin.

10. Common mimics and special ECG patterns
- Hyperkalemia:
  - Early: narrow, peaked T waves.
  - Progressive: PR prolongation, flattened P waves, wide QRS, sine‑wave pattern and risk of VF/asystole.
- Hypokalemia:
  - Flattened T waves, prominent U waves, ST depression.
- Pericarditis:
  - Diffuse concave ST elevation and PR depression (PR elevation and ST depression in aVR). No reciprocal changes as in localized MI.
- Early repolarization:
  - Common in young healthy adults: mild ST elevation, notched J point or slurring, often V4–V6; ST elevation usually concave and stable over time.
- CNS injury pattern:
  - Very tall, broad-based T waves and marked QT prolongation; often associated with severe intracranial events.
- Low voltage:
  - QRS amplitude <5 mm in limb leads or <10 mm in precordial leads; consider obesity, pericardial effusion, COPD, hypothyroidism, infiltrative disease.

11. Quick‑reference criteria and algorithms (concise)

A. Rate calculation
- Regular rhythm: 300 / # large boxes between R waves.
- Irregular rhythm: count QRS complexes in 6‑second strip ×10.

B. Axis determination (quick)
- Look at I and aVF:
  - I positive, aVF positive = normal axis.
  - I positive, aVF negative = left axis deviation (evaluate aVL).
  - I negative, aVF positive = right axis deviation.
  - I negative, aVF negative = extreme axis.

C. Approach to wide complex tachycardia
- Assume VT until proven otherwise.
- Look for AV dissociation, capture/fusion beats, concordance across precordium.
- Consider patient stability: unstable → immediate synchronized cardioversion; stable → antiarrhythmic therapy and diagnostics.

D. Immediate steps for suspected STEMI (ECG‑first workflow)
1) Confirm ST elevation criteria in contiguous leads and clinical correlate (ischemic chest pain).
2) Look for reciprocal changes and assess rhythm and hemodynamic stability.
3) If STEMI suspected, activate reperfusion pathway (PCI if available within guideline times) — time critical.
4) Obtain serial ECGs and right‑sided/posterior leads if indicated.
5) Provide initial supportive care: oxygen if hypoxic, aspirin, P2Y12 agent per protocol, nitrates if not hypotensive, analgesia, hemodynamic support as needed; avoid beta blockers if signs of heart failure or shock — follow local protocols/guidelines.

E. Algorithm for conduction block identification
- QRS <120 ms with PR prolongation → likely first-degree AV nodal block.
- QRS <120 ms with progressive PR prolongation then dropped beat → Mobitz I.
- QRS >120 ms with sudden dropped beat → Mobitz II more likely.
- AV dissociation → third-degree block.

12. Teaching pearls and pitfalls
- Always confirm calibration, paper speed, and lead placement if ECG is unexpected (limb lead reversal can change axis and morphology; chest lead misplacement can mimic pathologies).
- Compare with prior ECGs — many “abnormalities” are chronic.
- Look at the whole clinical picture: ECG is one data point; combine with history, exam, biomarkers, imaging.
- Serial ECGs are invaluable: ischemic changes evolve — repeat ECGs if clinical suspicion persists.
- Wide QRS tachycardia in a patient with structural heart disease is VT until disproven.
- In hyperkalemia, ECG changes may progress rapidly; treat based on clinical context, serum potassium and ECG findings.

13. Sample quick‑reference bullet lists (for rapid bedside use)

Bedside checklist for a new ECG
- Confirm patient identity, date/time, paper speed, calibration.
- Rate and rhythm: regular vs. irregular; is there a P before each QRS?
- PR, QRS, QT values (note prolonged intervals).
- Axis: normal / LAD / RAD.
- ST elevation/depression: leads and magnitude; reciprocal leads.
- New Q waves or marked T changes.
- Compare prior ECG.
- If concern for acute MI → activate protocol.

Common numeric cutoffs (summary)
- PR interval: normal 120–200 ms; >200 ms first‑degree AV block.
- QRS duration: <120 ms normal; ≥120 ms bundle branch block.
- QTc: <440 ms men, <460 ms women; ≥500 ms high risk.
- Significant ST elevation: ≥1 mm in contiguous limb leads; V2–V3 criteria higher.

14. References and further reading (clinical practice)
- Use current local and international guidelines (e.g., AHA/ACC, ESC) for acute coronary syndrome management and ECG criteria updates.
- For challenging cases (LBBB, paced rhythms), apply Sgarbossa and modified Sgarbossa rules and consult cardiology for early activation when clinical suspicion is high.

This guide is intended as a concise, clinically oriented reference for bedside ECG interpretation. For definitive diagnosis, always integrate with history, physical exam, biomarkers, imaging, and senior consultation where needed.
